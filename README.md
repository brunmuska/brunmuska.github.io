# Welcome to Brun Muska

Brun Muska is my favorite dish and symbolises the city where I started the dream-no extra points for guessing the city. It was only apt to name my website as brun muska. I am Amish  and this is mostly an archive so that I don't lose most of my work. You bet this was written over some chai and brun muska or maybe I am a coffee person, welcome anyway.

# C'est La Vie

The prime purpose of this website is this. To write about how life happens. Where it happens. What is life?
