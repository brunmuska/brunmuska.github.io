## Welcome to Brun Muska

Brun Muska is my favorite dish and symbolises the city where I started the dream. It was only apt to name my website as brun-muska. I am Amish S and this is an archive so that I don't lose most of my work. You bet this was written over some chai and brun muska or maybe I am a coffee person, welcome anyway.
