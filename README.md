# Welcome to Brun Muska

Brun Muska is my favorite food and symbolises the city where I started the dream-no extra points for guessing the city. Over a cup of brunmuska, I started thinking. And its over many many more cups of brun muska-tea that I have thought most of what constitutes me. It was only apt to name my website as brun muska. I am Amish  and this is mostly an archive so that I don't lose most of my work. You bet this was written over some chai and brun muska or maybe I am a coffee person, welcome anyway.
